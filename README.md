# Application Sample for Angular 6 + Angular Material + .Net Core + EF
When I started developing Single Page Applications I wouldâ€™ve liked to have a basic working implementation that demonstrated Angular 6, .NET Core, EF Core and Angular Material in an application.
After working in a couple of projects I decided to create one to use as a reference for my own projects.


## Case Scenario:
The fictious company organize private events for their customers.  An event is made up of venues, entertainers and customer information.
