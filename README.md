# Angular 6 + Angular Material + CRUD + .Net Core WebAPI
I wanted to create a sample application to use as a reference on implementations with Angular + Web API backend and EF Core using the Visual Studio Angular Template.

Iâ€™ve been working with Angular and .NET Core for some time and I find them a very good match to each other. I also wanted to use Angular Material to design the user interface since there are already implementations with Bootstrap. 
The purpose of this tutorial is to have a sample implementation to use as a reference for your own projects. 

# Case Scenario:
We are an event company that provides customers with customized events for their parties. We have a basic Web application to create and manage events. The idea is to have a database with venues, entertainers, customers and aggregate into events.

Clone the repository and create a new database either locally or in Azure. Modify the connection string and update the database using EF Core Tools.
